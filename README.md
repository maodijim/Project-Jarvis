Motor used for testing is MS90S Micro Servo
#### Stage 2: Just Started
    ** Objects recognition: Train to recognize normal house hold items using TensorFlow API and OpenCV Library **

    Trained model hasn't uploaded yet
#### Stage 3: Not Yet Started
    ** Understand obstacles and find the path to avoid them **
#### Stage 4: Not Yet Started
    ** Caterpillar track foot **
